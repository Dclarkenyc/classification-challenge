### Description:
The assignment was to use a dataset from an ISP to improve the email filtering
to identify spam from not spam.  The data was split, scaled and a logistic regression model 
 and a radom forest model and evalute the models.

### Usage:

spam_detector.ipynb file. The data came from an external source:
[Spam Data](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv)

### Known Issues:
At first I had issues with the regression model but then I imported some suggested classes
and it worked.  


### Acknowledgements:
I tried to work with Xpert Learning Assitant to help with the above issues 
which it resolved as noted.
